summary: "A Card Shuffle Simulator game that I developed in ICS 212."
---


This is a project I created in ICS 212. The program sets up a deck of 52 cards, assigning ranks and suits in order. It also assigns colors to the cards based on their suits. You can let the program deal cards until all the cards are displayed. You can enter 'Shuffle' to mix up the order of the cards, or enter 'Display' to show the current cards you hold. This project taught me how to handle random number generation and simple user inputs. It is an excellent practical example.
