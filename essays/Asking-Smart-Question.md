As a programmer, when faced with challenges, we often turn to online resources for assistance. As Eric Raymond points out, before seeking help, one should first attempt to solve the problem independently. If the issue remains unresolved, it's important to ask for help politely and succinctly. Also, it's essential to appreciate the effort of others in helping you.

## Good Question:
This example demonstrates a well-posed question. The title is straightforward, avoiding irrelevant queries. The post details the desired outcome, current progress, and encountered errors, making the user's language clear and understandable. Numerous solutions provided by other users make this post especially helpful for novice JavaScript learners.

## Bad Question:
In this instance, the user spent little effort on their post, repeatedly asking incomprehensible questions without sufficient information. Lacking basic etiquette and patience, the author repetitively posts their question, leading many volunteers to overlook such unproductive posts.
