Many people approach "coding standards" superficially, often worrying over details like indenting by two spaces or whether or not to add braces alone on each new line.

However, I believe coding standards would be the perfect software engineering technique to implement to improve quality. They have helped me learn new programming languages immensely! Do you agree?

How have your initial impressions of ESLint and IntelliJ been? Did it prove challenging or useful, both or something entirely different?

Write an engaging and engaging article on coding standards, covering some or all of the questions above or taking an entirely different angle on them. Make sure it offers your unique perspective and provides useful insight.

Many people mistake "coding standards" as mere cosmetic matters; such as debating which spaces to use for indentation and whether braces should stand alone on new lines. Although this perspective reveals only its formatting aspect of coding standards, this viewpoint fails to recognize their significant contribution towards improving code quality, team collaboration, and helping developers better comprehend programming languages themselves.

I strongly believe that implementation of coding standards would be the ideal technology to increase project quality in software development. Coding standards provide more than formatting rules; they cover structure, naming conventions, best practices and security considerations that all help improve code quality. By adhering to them, developers can avoid common pitfalls while improving code readability and maintainability - ultimately leading to smooth team collaboration and stabilizing projects.

My experience during the initial week of integrating ESLint and IntelliJ was complex and multidimensional. On one hand, chasing after that green checkmark could be painful at times, especially when it required me to change longstanding coding habits; such as variable naming rules or how I organized code blocks and functions. Yet this discomfort was worth it: this process allowed me to learn not just following rules but writing clearer, more organized, more comprehensible code for others as a result.

On the flip side, this process proved highly fruitful. Over time, I learned that following these coding standards wasn't simply about passing code checks or making my code look "standard." Instead, they helped me gain a deeper understanding of features and best practices within programming languages like ESLint's prompts made me more conscious of new features in ES6, such as arrow functions and template strings, that could make my code more concise and efficient.

Implementing coding standards does not compromise personal programming style or creativity; rather, they provide a shared foundation upon which different developers can build and expand while still maintaining high-quality code. Coding standards can be especially valuable in collaborative projects as everyone involved can easily understand and maintain each other's codebases.

Coding standards extend far beyond simple formatting rules; they're essential tools for improving code quality, encouraging team collaboration, and deepening language understanding. My experience has shown me that adhering to these standards may initially feel cumbersome or cumbersome at first; but over time they will significantly enhance both programming skills and project quality - thus encouraging all developers to embrace coding standards as opportunities for continuous growth and improvement.
