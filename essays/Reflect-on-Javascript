## Learning in Javascript
I have never touched JavaScript before, but I feel that JavaScript is quite convenient to use, especially for those with no programming experience. I believe JavaScript's syntax is more flexible compared to Java. Moreover, the most user-friendly aspect is that you can use web browsers to write and test code, unlike other languages that require downloading specific computer software.
## Good or Bad in Javascript
From a software engineering perspective, I consider JavaScript a good programming language. Whether it's watching movies online or searching for information, we inevitably use browsers. This is where I think JavaScript shines the most - in building web pages. Although other languages can also accomplish this, JavaScript is comparatively more convenient. Therefore, mastering JavaScript is very valuable for those who plan to work in web development in the future.
## Practice WOD
I think WOD exercises are stressful because they have to be completed within a specific time. This keeps students constantly in a state of learning. In your free time, you need to practice coding over and over to ensure you can complete the project within the allotted time. Otherwise, you will fall behind schedule. I personally find WOD exercises helpful as they keep us in a constant state of learning and make us aware of the urgency of time and the efficiency of learning.
