## Why I'm interested in Software Engineering
During high school, I was often asked what major I would choose and what I wanted to do in the future. As a result, driven by personal interest, I chose Computer Science. Previously, I had thought that software development was an easy and joyful task, where all I needed to do was sit by a computer and type. However, I've now realized how naive and simplistic those ideas were. Programming is actually a creative activity filled with both fun and challenges. When I successfully create something, I can feel immense joy and happiness.
## Things hope to gain
During my time at university, I hope to improve my teamwork skills, progressing and collaborating with others. I am looking forward to establishing an outstanding project, applying the knowledge I have learned into practice. At the same time, I also hope to apply these software skills to everyday life, creating software and programs that are both practical and interesting.
## Future and Goal
In summary, my choice of Computer Science was driven by my love for the field and a pursuit of innovation. In my university journey, I hope to become not just a technically skilled developer through collaboration and continuous learning, but also an innovator who can use technology to improve everyday life.
